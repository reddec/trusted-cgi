# Aliases

Links (or aliases) are useful to make public links and dynamically migrate between real implementations (functions). For ex:
you made a GitHub hook processor in the Python language, then changed your mind and switched to a PHP function. Instead of 
updating the link in your GitHub repo (that could be a hassle if you spread it everywhere) you can change just a link.

Important! Security settings and restrictions will be used from new functions.
